# Neural network validation for power systems

This project aims to build and train neural networks (NN) for power system validation of operational points.

# Dataset

The dataset is generated in MatLab using the library [Matpower](https://matpower.org/)

## Dataset detailts

First we take a test system from MatLab cases

# Python exploratory analysis

In this repo you can find a series of python notebook where data exploration was made
